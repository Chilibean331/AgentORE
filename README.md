# AgentORE Platform

This repository contains resources for Operation Rising Ember, including prompts, reports, and an OSINT toolkit.

## OSINT Toolkit

The `ORE/osint` module provides basic automation for scraping news, monitoring social media, collecting satellite imagery metadata, and storing intelligence. The toolkit supports exporting results to CSV and PDF, and generates an interactive map of collected incidents.
Use the generated `osint_map.html` to view collected intel on an interactive map.

See `ORE/osint/README.md` for details.
